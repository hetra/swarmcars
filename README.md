Swarming cars!

A small demonstration written in Javascript and some HTML. It uses HTML5's canvas functionality to render a bunch of cars and then a little bit of maths and logic to swarm them. The swarm target is chosen at random and is denoted by the red square on the screen. The cars swarm to it eventually. Tested in Firefox.
